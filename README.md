### Activ

Activ is a web app that allows users to post and share location-tagged video clips of sports with one another. Our idea to create Activ stemmed from our passion of going outside and being active during the global pandemic. We all enjoy doing outdoor activities, but didn’t have a platform to discover new places to go. So the purpose of Activ is to try to provide that platform. For example, let's say you’re on a cool hike. Then you could take a video of your activity and upload it to Activ. It would then be posted to the home feed along with the location of your activity, so other users within a set radial distance of you could see that video and potentially discover a new spot to explore.

### Installation:

### In order to intstall Activ, clone the project, switch to the project folder, and run: 

### 'npm install'

Running npm install should install the necessary node modules file.

In order to run the app on the host http://localhost:3000 you can run the command:

### 'npm start'

This will start the app in a web browser and should take you to the sign up screen.
